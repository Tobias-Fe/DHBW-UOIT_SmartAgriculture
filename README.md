# DHBW-UOIT_SmartAgriculture
This project aims to solve the agricultural problems of irrigation of crops and providing a sustainable antifreeze solution for those crops in an IoT context. A strawberry crop for example needs 0.5 litres of water a day in its 2-year growing period. If there isn't substantial rainfall in that timeframe the crops need to be watered to keep growing and bear fruit. Therefore a irrigation system fed with real-time data is needed to ensure the optimal growth of the plants by watering them according to the regional weather forecast. It also provides an antiifreeze technology by using local temperature data to protect the crops by freezing them gently with water from the irrigation system.
